# Kharidiron's Sopel modules

These are just some silly modules I've written for my [Sopel](https://sopel.chat) bot. Free for all to use and abuse.
These have been updated to **Python 3.7**, and will not work in anything earlier.

The idea for `.hug` was graciously stolen (with permission) from [GTG300](https://github.com/GTG3000).

The commands `.cake` and `.twerk` done by request for Pat.
